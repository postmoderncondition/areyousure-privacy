Privacy Policy

AreYouSure respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the app.

1. Personal Data

AreYouSure does not require you to create an account and does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number. Any assumptions or notes you create in the app are stored locally on your device.

2. App Usage Data

AreYouSure does not track user behavior, analytics, or usage patterns. No advertising or tracking technologies are used.

3. Network Requests and AI Features

Some features (such as the optional “Second Opinion”) may send user-provided text to a remote service in order to generate AI-based responses. Only the text you explicitly submit for this purpose is sent. No personal identifiers are attached to these requests. The transmitted data is used solely to generate a response and is not used for advertising.

4. Data Storage

All assumptions and confidence ratings are stored locally on your device. The app does not upload or sync your data to a personal account.

5. Third-Party Services

AreYouSure may rely on third-party services to process AI-generated responses. These services process data only for the requested functionality.

6. Children’s Privacy

AreYouSure is not designed for children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated as the app evolves. Changes will be reflected within the app or on this page.
